Graduation_Project
this repository is for Battery mangemet system graduatin project that consists of 5 modules and infomation about cells can be seen via a mobile app:
	1- data acquisition module	: reads voltage and current and temperature  for the cells
	2- thermal management module	: reads temprature and cools cells if it's high and icrease temprature if it's low
	3 - charge cotrol module	: decide if the baranch either charges , discharge or both
	4- cell balancing module	: try to make all branches have similar amount of charge(charged/ discharged evenly)
	5- communication module		: sends data to mobile app
the mobile app : TBD
